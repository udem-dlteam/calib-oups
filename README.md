# Development

The app is already available online through github pages (on push to main). The following instructions describe 
development steps to modify the app.

## How to deploy locally

To deploy the application, simply host the index.html with the associated files on a web server. To ease development, 
you can use a "live server" to change the webpage in real time. 
See [live server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) for more information.

You can also use python with `python -m http.server` or any other web server of your choice.
